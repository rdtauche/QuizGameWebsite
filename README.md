## Credits

Teachers: our instructor, Kevin Ferguson, provided us with some starter code which i utilized and tried to make my own.  I also had a tutoring session with Brandon Leek, who helped me fix my final score and replay button.

Google - I got stuck a few times but was able to search google to find similiar projects, and how they designed their script.js JavaScript code.  Some examples which helped guide me included:
